1.1 in the notes

\section{Estimate the yield strength for an absolutely perfect single crystal of Fe 
(and compare with the experimental value)}

\section{How is the yield strength defined, conventionally?}

\section{Brittle or ductile failure: what is better for a structural metal in tension, and why?}

\section{Why might you want to deform a metal plastically?}

\section{Examine the stress-strain curve of a perfect Fe whisker (in the presentation, or see notes.)  
a) is it linearly elastic?  b) is it elastic ?}
